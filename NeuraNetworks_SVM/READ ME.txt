FILES INSIDE THE ZIP:

A0313771H_SVM.pdf
Final report detailing the implementation, methodology, and results of the SVM project.

train.mat & test.mat
Provided datasets containing features and labels for spam email classification.

svm_discriminant.m
MATLAB script for Task 1, implementing SVM training and prediction using specified kernel functions.

svm_train_test.m
Script for Task 2, performing comprehensive evaluation of SVMs with various kernels and margin types. Outputs results into a CSV file.

svm_main.m
Script for Task 3, implementing and evaluating SVM with RBF (Gaussian) kernel on training, testing, and evaluation sets.

dummy_eval.m
Utility script that randomly selects 600 samples from test.mat and saves them as eval.mat, to simulate an unseen evaluation set.

svm_results_table.csv
Output table generated by svm_train_test.m, summarizing training/testing accuracy, kernel admissibility, and hyperplane existence for all settings.



HOW TO RUN:
Place all .m and .mat files in the same directory.
Ensure eval.mat is already loaded.
Launch svm_main.m to evaluate the RBF SVM on all three datasets: training, test, and evaluation.
To reproduce Task 2 results, run svm_train_test.m. This will generate the final svm_results_table.csv.
